 There are various shells available the most common one is called bash. Which stands for Bourne again stating your current shell.
 #**Shortcuts ## So you don't have deal with re-typing commands twice. You can reverse the history by using the up arrow a few times. You can edit commands by using left to right.
 **Shortcuts If you run command cd without any arguements then it will always take you back to your home directory. **cd**-Change Directories **ls** List-contents of a directory.
** A path** is means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.
There are two different paths ** Absolute And Relative** 1. *Absolute Path- Specifies a location ( file or directory) in relation to root directory. They would always begin with a forward slash(/).
2. Relative Path- specifies a location in relation to we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
#*Files*
Everything is a file , text, your keyboard, monitor,etc.
 a file extension is normally a set of 2-4 characters after a fullstop
 **These are common extensions**:
 Com 1.file.exe- an excutable file or program 2.file.txt-a plain text file 3.file.png, file.gif, file.jpg- an image
 linux is case-sensitive , no space for a single command line arguement.
 Anything inside quotes are considered a single item.(\) What the bacl slash does is escape or nullify the special meaning of the next character.
 **Hidden Directories**
 If a file name begins with .(fullstop) then it is considered to be hidden. The command ls will not display hidden files.
 You can modify this by including the command option -a so that it shows the hidden files.
 ls-a- this lists the contents if a directory including hidden files.
